## Introduction

I am a student dedicated to the field of cybersecurity, with sufficient skills in SOC and blue teaming. Currently working towards my Associate's Degree in Cybersecurity and Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science.

## Objective

Iâ€™ve always been fascinated by how people interact with computers and how attackers exploit those interactions. My mission in cybersecurity is to help protect those individuals and organizations from social engineering threats by leveraging SIEM and automation tools to detect attacks early, respond quickly, and reduce their real-world impact.
